A look at two of the majority-Australian owned Coal miners/exporters out here in the Australian east coast: Whitehaven Coal & New Hope Corp.

#### Thoughts 
* These two companies are similar in that both are export-oriented
* The equity time series for the two companies are potentially related (see chart above)
* The stock prices track the Newcastle price (AUD/mT)
